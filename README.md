Paint
=====

A simple Paint in C#.
Forked from Mohannad Alharthi.

Now is being refactored - just as a excercise for good design and clean code.
Today it is a big mess inside ;) Moreover the project is paused now.
I'm planning to resume the work in a few months, maybe about Q3, 2016.

In the (rather distant) future I'll play with some image processing and pattern recognition stuff.
